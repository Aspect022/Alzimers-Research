## 📊 Project Summary

**KnoAD-Net** is a multi-modal deep learning system that combines MRI brain imaging with clinical data to detect Alzheimer's Disease. Key innovations:

✅ Vision Transformer (ViT) for MRI analysis  
✅ Cross-modal attention for imaging + clinical data fusion  
✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for explainable predictions  
✅ Optimized for CPU training (AMD Ryzen 5000)  
✅ Three-class classification: CN / MCI / AD
