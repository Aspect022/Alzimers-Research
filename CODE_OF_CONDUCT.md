## Special Considerations for Medical AI Research

Given the sensitive nature of Alzheimer's Disease research and medical AI, we have additional standards:

### Research Ethics

* **Patient Privacy**: Never share or request identifiable patient information
* **Data Security**: Handle all medical data with appropriate security measures
* **Responsible AI**: Consider bias, fairness, and ethical implications
* **Transparency**: Be honest about limitations and potential risks
* **No Clinical Claims**: Do not present research results as clinical diagnoses

### Scientific Integrity

* **Reproducibility**: Share methods and code to enable verification
* **Proper Citation**: Always credit original work and datasets (e.g., OASIS)
* **Honest Reporting**: Report both successes and failures
* **Peer Review**: Accept and provide constructive scientific critique
* **Responsible Communication**: Avoid sensationalism about capabilities

### Respectful Discourse

* **Patient-Centered**: Remember that real people and families are affected by Alzheimer's
* **Sensitivity**: Discuss medical conditions with appropriate respect and empathy
* **Constructive Criticism**: Focus on improving science, not attacking individuals
* **Collaborative Spirit**: We're all working toward the same goal
